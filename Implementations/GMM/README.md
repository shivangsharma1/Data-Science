# GMM

In this notebook, there is a comparison between 2 algorithms. By analysing the results we saw that GMM outnumbered KMeans algorithm.
I have tested these 2 algorithm on 2 datasets.

## Regarding data:

I am using make_blobs function from sklearn library to generate gausssian blobs and Iris data.
