# Advance House Price Prediction

In this implementation, we are doing feature engineering and exploratory data analysis on the dataset. I have picked this dataset from Kaggle, Advance House Price Predictions Competitions.

The libraries used for Exploratory Data Analysis are:
Numpy
Seaborn
matplotlib


For feature engineering we are scaling the features and then selecting the features
